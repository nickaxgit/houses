# House viewing app

Use npm start to run this app in the IDE - then visit localhost:3000 (and possibly refresh)

The program requires the node backend (houses-backend) - which integrates with the FireTexes SMS API

We also conducted an excercise to illustrate viewstate - by adding a show/hide button
